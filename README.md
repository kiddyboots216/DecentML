# Interoperable Federated Learning

![Federated Learning](materials/fed_learning.png)

Code re-implementation and extension of the Federated Learning paper, [
Communication-Efficient Learning of Deep Networks from Decentralized Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.05629.pdf). Written in Python with support for TensorFlow and Keras (beta). PyTorch support coming soon.
